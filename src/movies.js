function getAllDirectors(data){

    const getDirectors = data.map((data)=>{return (data.director)})
    return getDirectors

// Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best? - How many drama movies did STEVEN SPIELBERG direct?
function howManyMovies(data){
const getSS = data.filter((data)=>{return data.director === `Steven Spielberg`&& data.genre.includes(`Drama`)})
return(getSS.length)
}
