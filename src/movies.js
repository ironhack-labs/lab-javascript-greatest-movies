Since this is a warm up, we will give you a hint:
you have to map through the array of movies and
get all the directors into one array as a final result.
Go ahead and create a function named getAllDirectors()
that receives an array of movies as an argument and returns a new (mapped) array.*/

This should be easy using one of the methods we have just learned.
Create a function orderByYear() that receives an array as a parameter
and returns a new sorted array.

If two movies have the same year, order them in alphabetical order by their title!

Important: Your function should return a new array,
containing the movies ordered by the year.
Your function should not modify (mutate) the original array.
You may need to do some research on how to make a "copy" or "clone" an array.
