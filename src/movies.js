// Iteration 1: All directors? - Get the array of all directors.
/*### Iteration 1: All directors


We need to get the array of all directors. Since this is a warm up, we will give you a hint: you have to _map_ through the array of movies and get all the directors into one array as a final result. Go ahead and create a function named `getAllDirectors()` that receives an array of movies as an argument and returns a new (_mapped_ array). */


 





// _Bonus_: It seems some of the directors had directed multiple movies so they will pop up multiple times in the array of directors. How could you "clean" a bit this array and make it unified (without duplicates)?

// Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best? - How many drama movies did STEVEN SPIELBERG direct?

// Iteration 3: All rates average - Get the average of all rates with 2 decimals

// Iteration 4: Drama movies - Get the average of Drama Movies

// Iteration 5: Ordering by year - Order by year, ascending (in growing order)

// Iteration 6: Alphabetic Order - Order by title and print the first 20 titles

// BONUS - Iteration 7: Time Format - Turn duration of the movies from hours to minutes

// BONUS - Iteration 8: Best yearly rate average - Best yearly rate average
