// _Bonus_: It seems some of the directors had directed multiple movies so they will pop up multiple times in the array of directors. How could you "clean" a bit this array and make it unified (without duplicates)?

// Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best? - How many drama movies did STEVEN SPIELBERG direct?
function howManyMovies(arr) {
    return arr.filter(function (arr) {
    return arr.director === 'Steven Spielberg' && arr.genre.includes('Drama')

// Iteration 4: Drama movies - Get the average of Drama Movies

// Iteration 5: Ordering by year - Order by year, ascending (in growing order)

// Iteration 6: Alphabetic Order - Order by title and print the first 20 titles

// BONUS - Iteration 7: Time Format - Turn duration of the movies from hours to minutes

// BONUS - Iteration 8: Best yearly rate average - Best yearly rate average
