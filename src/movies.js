// Iteration 1: All directors? - Get the array of all directors.

function getAllDirectors(arr) {
    let allDirectors = arr.map((eachMovie) => {
        return eachMovie.director;
    })
    return allDirectors;
}
// _Bonus_: It seems some of the directors had directed multiple movies so they will pop up multiple times in the array of directors. How could you "clean" a bit this array and make it unified (without duplicates)?



// Iteration 2: Steven Spielberg. The best? - How many drama movies did STEVEN SPIELBERG direct?
function howManyMovies(arr) {
    let steven = arr.filter((eachMovie) => {
        return eachMovie.director === `Steven Spielberg` && eachMovie.genre.includes(`Drama`);
    })
    console.log(steven.length);
    return steven.length;
}
